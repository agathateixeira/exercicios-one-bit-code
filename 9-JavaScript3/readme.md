# Measurement converter

## :dart: Objective: :dart:

Write a JavaScript program that works as a unit converter. The program should ask for a value in meters and then give the option to choose which unit of measure this value should be converted to. The options are:

- millimeter (mm)
- centimeter (cm)
- decimeter (dm)
- decameter (dam)
- hectometer (hm)
- kilometer (km)
  The program should then convert the measurement according to the chosen option and display the result. The program should also display an "Invalid Option" message if the user enters an option other than those available (use break and default for this).
