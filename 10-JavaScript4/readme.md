# Lista de cidades

## :dart: Objetivo: :dart:

Write a JavaScript program that asks for a tourist's name and then asks if they have visited any cities. If the answer is yes, ask for the name of the city and store it in a variable, and then continue asking if the tourist has visited any other cities until the answer is no. At the end, the program should display the tourist's name, how many cities they visited, and which cities they visited.
